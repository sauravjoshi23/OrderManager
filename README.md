# OrderManager
Our Web application is basically a well ordered and an efficient order management system.As in rush hours it is difficult to manage orders.So the solution that we have devised provides features for efficient time management by reducing the average waiting time as for example the first customer who enters the restaurant orders a dish having processing time 10s and the second customer might have processing time 2s so the second customer gets service first and the total waiting time for customer on an overall basis decreases. Alongwith that we have predicted the amount of material the restaurant might require on a day to day basis.Due to this the amount of waste generated by buying extra materials will be prevented and will affect the environment in a better way.
